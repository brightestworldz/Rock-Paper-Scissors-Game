Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors.
The game is between two players
one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the user (i.e CPU vs Player).
